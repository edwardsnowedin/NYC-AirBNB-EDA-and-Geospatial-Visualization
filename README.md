# NYC-AirBNB-EDA-and-Geospatial-Visualization

Overview:

This project focuses on performing an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an NYC Airbnb dataset. The primary objective is to gain insights into the Airbnb listings in New York City through various stages of data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques: 

1. Data Cleaning:
The project begins with a thorough data cleaning process to ensure the dataset is in a suitable format for analysis. This involves handling missing values, addressing inconsistencies, and formatting issues.

2. Statistical Analysis:
Statistical analysis is a crucial component of the project, aiming to uncover patterns, relationships, and trends within the NYC Airbnb dataset. Descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis can be employed to explore factors influencing listing prices, occupancy rates, or any other relevant variables of interest.

3. Data Visualization:
To enhance understanding and communicate insights effectively, I employed data visualization techniques, utilizing libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn primarily.

4. Geospatial Visualization:
Given the nature of the dataset, geospatial visualization becomes an essential aspect of the analysis. Mapping Airbnb listings onto New York City's geography can reveal spatial patterns and provide insights into price differentials across different areas of the city.
